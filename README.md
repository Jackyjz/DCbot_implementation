# DCbot_implementation


This discord bot implmentation is a part of a server maintainence project 

The goal is to 
- handle server invitations
-  role assignment
-  automatic code notifications
-  exercise practice
-  allow users to create anonymous messages.


*Another idea for the Discord bot, is to integrate OpenAI into it as well, using embeddings with the subtitles for lectures it could reply with timestamps in the lecture recordings to student questions.
